# Project images

Each case study has its own folder (slug matches the URL: `/projects/<slug>`).

## Required first export: `thumb.jpg`

Put a **cover thumbnail** here as **`thumb.jpg`** (JPEG or WebP if you rename in code — default is `.jpg`).

- **Aspect ratio:** ~**4:3** matches the “More projects” grid and nav previews.
- **Pixel size:** **1200×900** is plenty for retina cards; **1600×1200** if you want headroom. Larger than ~2500px wide is usually unnecessary for the web.
- **File size:** Aim under **~300KB** per thumb if you can (compress in Figma / ImageOptim / Squoosh) so the site stays fast.

## Extra assets (later)

Add more files in the same folder (e.g. `hero.jpg`, `screen-01.png`) when we wire real imagery into case study sections. Those names are not used by the app until we point the page at them.

## Squarespace

You do **not** need Squarespace live to move forward. Export images from your files / Figma / old backups and drop them into these folders locally, then run `npm run dev` to preview.
